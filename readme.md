Detailed Plan
M1: Project setup and environment configuration

Set up a virtual environment for the project
Install Pygame library
Create a GitHub repository for version control
M2: Basic game loop implementation

Initialize Pygame and set up the game window
Create the main game loop that handles events and updates the game state
Implement a frame rate cap using Pygame's clock


M3: Tetris grid, pieces, and game mechanics implementation

Design the Tetris grid (e.g., 10x20)
Create Tetris pieces (T, S, Z, L, J, I, and O) using a matrix representation
Implement piece rotation and initial spawn location
Generate random pieces for gameplay
M4: Collision detection and piece manipulation

Develop functions to detect collisions (with walls, floor, and other pieces)
Implement piece movement (left, right, down) with collision checks
Handle piece rotation with collision checks
Implement hard drop functionality
M5: Scoring system and game over conditions

Develop a scoring system based on line clears (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4 lines at once)
Implement a level system to increase game speed over time
Detect game over condition when a new piece cannot be spawned
M6: User interface and controls

Create a simple user interface displaying the score, level, and upcoming piece
Implement keyboard controls (left, right, down, rotation, hard drop, and pause)
Add a menu screen and a pause screen
M7: Testing and debugging

Test gameplay mechanics, collision detection, and user interface
Debug any issues and optimize performance
M8: Final packaging and deployment

Package the game for distribution (e.g., using PyInstaller)
Create a README file with instructions on how to run the game
Upload the final version to the GitHub repository
